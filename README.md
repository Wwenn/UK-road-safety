# UK-road-safety
In the traditional mindset, female drivers are always more prone to traffic accidents because of their 'poor' driving skills. But is this the case? Are young people more likely to be involved in traffic accidents than middle-aged people? When are traffic accidents more likely to happen, at Night or during the day? In which city or clusters in the UK are traffic accidents most likely to occur? How about the weather, road, and junction conditions.

In this project, we will answer all of these questions. We hope to find the characteristics, spatial and temporal distribution, and future trends of traffic accidents by exploring the Road Safety database with data analysis and visualization.

The advent of covid-19 was a huge disaster for humanity, and many people lost their lives and got sick due to covid-19, but it also changed human travel habits - reducing traffic trips and increasing the time spent at home. Therefore, we will further analyze the relationship between epidemics and road safety.
